IN CSS files
	For class names
	or
	ID names
	dont put weird names
	Put like 
	
	EX:
	for navagation 
		class=nav
	for main part
		class= main
	for main part first picture
		class = mainfirstpic
	etc.
	
	
	Also try to put comments
		About css part 
			For example
				css what is the purpose of that class?
					ex: 
						<ul class="navigation        <!-- This css is navigation -->
						aefaefsoeifnsidfoisdjf
						</ul>
				this is simple but its better to put all of them because if you dont put at the end when 
				we want to play on it. we may have difficulties to play on it.
