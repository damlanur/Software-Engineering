Home= Ihsan Karagol
Events=Baktibek
Calendar=Rowshen
Galeria= Damlanur


-For Home Page(Ihsan)
	Why?
	You guys already know I am working on Home page 
	for your parts
	Also you guys want me to do that and I believe I can do that 

-For Events (Baktibek)
	Why?

	I believe baktibek knows html and than he can have creative ideas about events 
	how to organize people. Prepare events etc.

-For Calendar (Rowshen)
	Why? 
	I was hardly choose between Rowshen and Damlanur which one can do? 
	and after that I see that 
	Damlanur knows 
		maybe better than rowshen also I realize that she can also can get help 
		from her other friends.
	For Rowshen I see that 
		-he may have difficulties to create new ideas because he is working and
		have some issues to come together and may have difficulties to find 
		time to do. 
		Also at the same time he has to learn how to do his ideas? etc.
		- Also I know that he wants this part
		that means probably he already some ideas he can do that.
-For Galeria (Damlanur)
	Why? 
	For Characteristics girls have more care about view (vision)
		(How beautiful with color and design, or (Uygunluk) )
	Also I see that she can get some help from her friends she can find time for 
	get together with her friends to get help. 
	
	Also Damlanur if you cannot do anything for your part you can
	 find different topic 
		like: 
		-Educate(Train) your Child
			- How to educate your child
			- Different kind of trainings (think like our school clubs)	
 		-Students Financial Problems
		-Students success steps 
		-etc
	Just try to find something, that will fit in topic. Also your part will be look 
	professional
